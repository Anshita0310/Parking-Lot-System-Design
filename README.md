# 🏙️ System Design for Parking Lot Architecture

This project presents the **System Design of a Parking Lot**, covering all stages of architectural planning — from requirements gathering to design visualization.  
It includes **functional and non-functional requirements**, **database schema design**, **low-level and high-level architecture**, **use case diagrams**, and **flowcharts** illustrating the complete system behavior.
